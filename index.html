			<h3>Course Expectations</h3>

			<p>
				The expectations for the course are that students will attend every class, do any readings assigned for
				class, and actively and constructively participate in class discussions. Class participation will be a
				measure of contributing to the discourse both in class, through discussion and questions, and outside of
				class through contributing and responding to the discussion forum. More information about course requirements will be made available leading up to the start of classes
			</p>

			<h3>Ethics Statement</h3>

			<p>
				This course includes topics related to computer security and privacy. As part of this investigation,
				we may cover technologies whose abuse could infringe on the rights of others. As computer scientists, we
				rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use includes circumvention of an existing
				security or privacy mechanisms for any purpose, or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of
				vulnerabilities of these services. Any activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be
				reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class and possibly more severe
				academic and legal sanctions.
			</p>

			<h3>Credits</h3>

			<p>
				This course is based on NEU's CS 4740/6740 Network Security course, taught by Professor Christo Wilson.
